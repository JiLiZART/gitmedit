# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

**Core value:** Fast, distraction-free git editor with nano's simplicity that understands git's context (commits, merges, rebases, squashes) without bloat
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Git Contract + TUI Shell

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Git Contract + TUI Shell)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-18 — Roadmap created from requirements and research

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-planning]: Do NOT use alternate screen (EnterAlternateScreen) — renders into main buffer like nano; foundational Phase 1 architecture decision, changing it later requires restructuring all terminal init/restore code
- [Pre-planning]: Stack is ratatui 0.30 + crossterm 0.29 + ratatui-textarea 0.8; no tokio/async needed
- [Pre-planning]: Phase 4 depends on Phase 2 (not Phase 3) — rebase/squash require working editor, not commit intelligence

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2 risk]: core.commentChar = auto handling algorithm not fully specified in research; consult git source (commit.c) during Phase 2 planning
- [Phase 4 risk]: Squash context detection (identifying git-generated "This is a combination of N commits" block) requires verifying exact git comment format before coding
